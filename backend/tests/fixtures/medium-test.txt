# Medium Test File for File Transfer Laboratory

This file is designed to test medium-sized file transfers.

## Test Scenarios
- TCP reliable transfer with 8KB chunks
- UDP fire-and-forget with 1KB chunks
- Cross-network communication via router
- Bidirectional transfer validation

## Network Topology
Machine A (172.20.0.10) <-> Router <-> Machine B (172.21.0.10)
